  <h2>Nest Population</h2>
  <p>Myrmecia aberrans nests typically contain a relatively small population of workers. They are known to have a maximum of around 20 workers in a nest. This species exhibits a semi-social behavior with small colony sizes compared to some other Myrmecia species.</p>
  
  <h2>Distribution and Preferred Habitat</h2>
  <p>Myrmecia aberrans is native to southern Australia, specifically found in the states of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. They prefer open woodlands, heathlands, and coastal areas. These ants construct their nests in sandy soil and often forage on the ground surface, preying on other insects and scavenging for food.</p>
  
  <h2>Rarity</h2>
  <p>Myrmecia aberrans is considered a relatively rare species. Their populations are not commonly encountered, and they have a limited range within their native habitats. Due to their specific habitat requirements and the specialized nature of their behaviors, their presence is often an indication of a healthy and well-preserved ecosystem.</p>
